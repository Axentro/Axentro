  # This is a super class of every user defined dApps.
  #
  # You can access blockchain by `blockchain` and node by `node` from your dApp.
  # But if you change the data on it manually, your node will be rejected from other nodes.
  # So basically they are read-only.
  #
  # When you create a dApp, you have to override 6 functions.
  # You can read the details of each function below.
  #
  # **********************************************************************
  # Note that you have to modify a dapps.cr as well to activate your dApps

    # As a restriction of dApps on SushiChain, you have to host a node to create transactions in your dApps.

    # Hard code valid addresses and return it as a array of strings.

    # For example, if your dApp related to the transactions which have "some_action" action, return this.
    # ```
    # ["some_action"]
